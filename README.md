# <u>**HBM Nuclear Tech Mod - 1.12.2 (Still unnamed) Edition**</u>

Here im trying to make something good for Alcater's fork and my version of NTM (it's scary, i don't recommend you to even see it).

This is my 1.12.2 custom version of the Nuclear Tech Mod (Yeah, another one)

which is forked from the fork made by [Alcater](https://github.com/Alcatergit/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is forked from the fork made by [TheOriginalGolem](https://github.com/TheOriginalGolem/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is forked from the port made by [Drillgon200](https://github.com/Drillgon200/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT)
which is ported from the original mod made by [HBMTheBobcat](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT).


The latest version can be found only here. 

If you have question or suggestions you can ask me in Discord [#scrap_metal_10011101] (English isn't my best language))

### **Want to contribute?**

If you want to contribute make a pull request and I'll review it as i will see it.
Every contribution is very much appreciated by me and the players.

Download the repository, then open a shell prompt in that folder, then type the following:
